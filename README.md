## Duke Visualization Challenge

Recently, Scholars@Duke and The Graduate School of Duke University published datasets describing their faculty, publications, and PhD dissertation committees. They invited researchers and data scientists to participate in a [visualization challenge](https://rc.duke.edu/scholars-vis-challenge/) to explore questions like:

- Can faculty publications and PhD dissertation committees show how disciplines overlap?
- What can the makeup of dissertation committees tell us about trends in research?
- How many Duke faculty cross departmental and school boundaries in their publishing and teaching activities, and can these activities be visualized?
 
Aghil (my collaborator who is a graduate student at Duke) and I put together a poster that he presented at Duke Research Computing Symposium, and we received the third prize for this visualization. Hereâ€™s the poster we presented at the symposium:
