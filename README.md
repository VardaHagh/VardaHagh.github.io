# My Personal Projects
# Duke Visualization 

Recently, Scholars@Duke and The Graduate School of Duke University published data sets on their faculty, publications, and PhD dissertation committees and invited researchers to explore questions like:

⋅⋅* Can faculty publications and PhD dissertation committees show how disciplines overlap?
⋅⋅* What can the makeup of dissertation committees tell us about trends in research?
⋅⋅* How many Duke faculty cross departmental and school boundaries in their publishing and teaching activities, and can these activities be visualized?
