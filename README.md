## Duke Visualization 

Recently, Scholars@Duke and The Graduate School of Duke University published datasets describing their faculty, publications, and PhD dissertation committees. They invited researchers and data scientists to participate in a [visualization challenge](https://rc.duke.edu/scholars-vis-challenge/) to explore questions like:

- Can faculty publications and PhD dissertation committees show how disciplines overlap?
- What can the makeup of dissertation committees tell us about trends in research?
- How many Duke faculty cross departmental and school boundaries in their publishing and teaching activities, and can these activities be visualized?
